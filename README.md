A React front end that requests a payload through [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) using [Midpoint Labs](https://www.midpointapi.com/about) as a third party a hybrid backend. Midpoint labs provides the framweork for smart contract that houses the [DaLLE 2](https://openai.com/api/) program. This serves as end point to access the AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. Images are minted using the [ERC 270 Token contract through Georli Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/docs/guides/testing/#erc-721-tokens). These NFTS are stored via [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/docs/concepts/gateways/#the-nftstorage-gateway). A service that leverages the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.tech/#why) as a key part of its storage and retrieval infrastructure. Users are seemlessly connected to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) over the Etherium mainnet to retrieve their wallet address and link their newly minted NFT as their digital avatar.
